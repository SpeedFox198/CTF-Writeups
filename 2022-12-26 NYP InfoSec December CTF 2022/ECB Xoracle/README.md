# ECB Xoracle

## Challenge Description

I implemented an additional step in my encryption/decryption service and declare its name as "Xoracle". It should be more secure, right?


## Understanding the code

The name of the challenge "**Xor**acle" suggests that the key to solving the challenge is related to the XOR function.

The encryption service uses a new random key for every encryption, this suggests that we do not need to "crack" AES encryption
